# Olad

## Introduction

Olad, essentially a Peer-review as a service, aims to improve the scientific industry's system of validating and accepting manuscripts. It introduces incentives, standardizes quality, and increases efficiency. The whitepaper can be found [here](https://anik8das.medium.com/peer-review-as-a-service-a-potential-gamechanger-for-science-4989763adcf6).

## App description

This is an MVP for trial runs and hypotheses testing. It uses a React for frontend, node for backend, express for communication, MySql for database, Heroku for backend deployment, and Netlify for frontend deployment. The features include the ability for journals to register and upload manuscripts, administrator to assign papers and have regulatory control, and for reviewers to manage assignments and add annotations. <br><br>
